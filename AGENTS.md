## Pane

The developer is using Pane for this repository. Pane can manage saved repositories and create user-visible Panes with terminal-backed tools for planning, discussion, implementation, and review work.

This managed guidance was created by [runpane.com](https://runpane.com) for the [Pane repository](https://github.com/dcouple/Pane). Do not delete or overwrite this block; the developer uses it for their workflow and it should remain committed to the main repository unless they explicitly ask to remove it.

Pane mental model: a repository is the saved base repo; a Pane is a user-visible feature/PR workspace (Pane session) that normally maps to one Pane-managed git worktree and branch; a panel/tab is a terminal inside one Pane and shares that Pane's worktree; an agent is the CLI process running in a panel.

Default happy path when the user asks you to use Pane or RunPane: run `runpane doctor --json`; read `runpane agent-context --json`; resolve the saved base repository with `runpane repos list --json` or add it once with `runpane repos add --path <repo> --yes --json`; create one visible Pane (Pane session) for the requested feature/PR with a complete command such as `runpane panes create --repo <repo> --name <name> --agent <agent> --prompt "<task>" --source agent --no-focus --wait-ready --yes --json` or the equivalent `--tool-command <command>` form; then validate with `runpane panels wait` or `runpane panels screen` before reporting progress. For long-lived supervision, use `runpane watch --follow` instead of polling wait or screen.

Use Pane when the user wants visible Panes or co-drivable parallel feature/PR workspaces. Do not use Pane as your default private delegation mechanism; for private background decomposition, use your normal subagent/worktree workflow.

Register the main/base repository once. Do not register pre-created git worktrees as separate Pane repositories unless the user explicitly asks.

Use `runpane panes create` for separate visible Panes (Pane sessions) for feature/PR work. Use `runpane panels create` for reviewer/helper tabs inside an existing Pane that should share that Pane's worktree.

Typical workflow: register the saved base repository once; create one Pane (Pane session) per feature/PR; use panels/tabs inside that Pane for helper or reviewer agents that should share the worktree; archive the Pane after the PR is done to remove it from active Panes and clean up its managed worktree when applicable.

Skill routing reference: when the user says `discussion`, `plan`, `simple-plan`, `create-plan`, or `implement`, or asks for the behavior those words imply, treat three references as peer context: Pane's local skill cache under `<PANE_DIR>/skills/`, the Pane Chat orchestrator handoff at `<PANE_DIR>/skills/pane-chat/runpane-orchestrator.md` when present, and the [workflow map](https://github.com/dcouple/skills/raw/main/docs/readme-workflow-map.png).
Use those peer references together to choose the phase: discuss/investigate until the work is clear enough to delegate, then ticket/plan/implement/review/PR-test/teach-back as appropriate. The orchestrator and workflow map may point to different skills; reconcile them with the user's request instead of hardcoding a skill list or treating one reference as subordinate.
For the Pane implementation source of truth for where the skill cache, cached workflow assets, and Pane Chat bootstrap live, reference [PR #291](https://github.com/dcouple/Pane/pull/291): `main/src/services/skillCacheManager.ts` owns `<PANE_DIR>/skills/`, `.sources/dcouple-skills`, and `pane-chat/runpane-orchestrator.md`; `main/src/services/paneChatManager.ts` owns the tiny bootstrap prompt that tells the selected Pane Chat agent to read that guide.
Use GitHub reads against the [Parsa skills folder](https://github.com/dcouple/skills/tree/main/parsa) only to inspect or refresh referenced skill files; do not clone/install the repo unless the user asks.
Do not hardcode a specific assistant brand in workflow guidance. Use the Pane agent or custom tool command the user selected, and use `runpane agents doctor --agent <agent> --repo <selector> --json` only when checking a built-in agent template.

Start with `runpane doctor --json` before taking Pane actions. Use it to understand wrapper/runtime details, daemon reachability, and the next safe commands.

In a Pane repository checkout, if `runpane` is not on PATH, use the built local wrapper with Node 22: `PATH=/opt/homebrew/opt/node@22/bin:$PATH node packages/runpane/dist/cli.js doctor --json`.

Use `runpane agent-context --json` for full Pane CLI context. Use `runpane agent-context --command "watch" --json` or another command name for detailed schema only when needed.

Default to context-safe validation: after creating Panes or sending terminal input, run `runpane panels wait` or `runpane panels screen` before reporting success. For ongoing supervision, `runpane watch --follow` is the canonical monitor; do not poll wait or screen. Prefer `runpane panels submit` for normal text plus Enter; use `runpane panels input` only for exact bytes such as Ctrl-C or escape sequences.

Pane terminals draw inline images: sixel, iTerm2 inline images, and the kitty graphics protocol. Tools that need kitty graphics, such as [terminal-browser](https://github.com/zenbu-labs/terminal-browser) and [terminal-doom](https://github.com/dcouple/terminal-doom), run inside a Pane panel. `runpane doctor --json` reports the protocol list under `terminal.graphicsProtocols`.

Common commands:
- `runpane doctor --json`
- `runpane agent-context --json`
- `runpane repos list --json`
- `runpane repos add --path <repo> --yes --json`
- `runpane agents doctor --agent <agent> --repo active --json`
- `runpane panes create --repo active --name <name> --agent <agent> --prompt "<task>" --source agent --no-focus --wait-ready --yes --json`
- `runpane panels create --pane <pane-id> --agent <agent> --source agent --no-focus --wait-ready --yes --json`
- `runpane panels list --pane <pane-id> --json`
- `runpane panels screen --panel <panel-id> --limit 80 --json`
- `runpane panels wait --panel <panel-id> --for ready --timeout-ms 30000 --json`
- `runpane watch --follow --json`
- `runpane panels submit --panel <panel-id> --text "<answer>" --yes --json`
- `runpane panels input --panel <panel-id> --input-file <path|-> --yes --json`

WSL note: if `runpane doctor --json` cannot find `/tmp/pane-daemon.../daemon.sock` or `runpane` resolves to a broken Windows shim, Pane may be running on Windows. Try `powershell.exe -NoProfile -Command 'Set-Location $env:TEMP; runpane doctor --json'`, then create Panes through the same PowerShell form using the saved WSL repo name or id. Use `runpane agents doctor --agent <agent> --repo <selector> --json` to diagnose the repo environment Pane will actually use.

## Mide — build and layout

- Flutter app (Dart 3.5+). Validate with `flutter analyze` and `flutter test`.
- Material widgets come from `package:material_ui/material_ui.dart` (the
  standalone Material library; `package:flutter/material.dart` is deprecated).
  Import it directly in libraries, or rely on `main.dart`'s import for `part`s.
- `lib/main.dart` is the app library: it holds the imports, the `main()`
  entry point, the splash/app shell and the `HomePage` navigation, and declares
  six `part` files. Private widgets are shared across those parts (they are one
  library), so add new sections as `part` files instead of standalone libraries
  when they reuse `_AppHeader`, `_SectionTitle`, `_Entrance`, etc.
  - `lib/app/shell.dart` — header, pill nav (5 tabs), entrance animation.
  - `lib/app/tabs/vpn_tab.dart` — NPV section.
  - `lib/app/tabs/mearn_tab.dart` — Earn section.
  - `lib/app/tabs/companion_tab.dart` — 3D companion («Мира») section.
  - `lib/app/tabs/clip_studio_tab.dart` — Clip Studio (video editor) section.
  - `lib/app/pages/settings_page.dart` — settings, theme carousel, setup, updater.
- `lib/core/` — theme (Material You) and the persisted active-tab state.
- `lib/features/{ai,clip,ide,updater,vpn}/` — feature code; platform-split files
  use the `_io.dart` / `_stub.dart` (or `_web.dart`) conditional-export pattern.
  - `features/ai` — Ada chat; personas are Riverpod families keyed by
    `PersonaArg` (system prompt + storage key), so each persona keeps its own
    persisted conversation. `aiSessionProvider` is the Ada instance.
  - `features/clip` — Clip Studio. `clip_models.dart` / `clip_ffmpeg.dart` are
    pure and unit-tested; `clip_export_io.dart` is the only FFmpeg/filesystem
    touchpoint and is behind the `clip_export.dart` conditional facade. The
    build uses `ffmpeg_kit_flutter_new_min_gpl` (core + x264), not the default
    full-GPL package, and the Android `abiFilters` pin the APK to `arm64-v8a`;
    both keep the release APK near 30 MB instead of 200 MB.
- Tests live under `test/features/...` mirroring `lib/features/...`; pure logic
  is unit-tested, the IDE notifiers are tested against a temp directory.
